# Research Control Theory

## Workflow

1. Specify dynamics, observations, inputs, disturbances and constraints.
2. Check controllability, observability or weaker stabilizability and detectability conditions.
3. Choose control and estimation methods matching linearity, sampling and uncertainty.
4. Account for discretization, delays and saturation; state the scope of stability or robustness guarantees.

## Evidence and completion rules

Keep a ledger distinguishing supplied facts, externally verified results, proved claims, conjectures and computational observations. State domains, quantifiers, assumptions and unresolved obligations. Verify external theorem hypotheses at their application site and cite a precise primary-source locator when available; never invent references. Read supplied source material before relying on it. Report actual commands and checker outcomes only when tools ran. Treat finite examples and plots as evidence rather than unrestricted proofs.

Use the user’s language. Load only relevant adjacent skills: use proof review for auditing, counterexample search for falsification, and existing algorithm or numerical implementation skills for software work. Pass the exact statement, assumptions and unresolved obligations to subsequent work. Read [acceptance-cases.md](references/acceptance-cases.md) before declaring completion.

## Deepening

Read [decision-guide.md](references/decision-guide.md) for method-selection checkpoints, additional behavioral cases and the output contract. Read [acceptance-cases.md](references/acceptance-cases.md) for the domain-specific boundary case. Treat these cases as acceptance checks, not evidence of generalization.

Read [method-selection.md](references/method-selection.md) for candidate techniques, their selection conditions and failure alternatives. Use it together with this specialization’s exact workflow.

Read [domain-playbook.md](references/domain-playbook.md) when choosing a domain-specific method, checking applicability hypotheses, or needing a worked derivation and a failure witness. Its explicit gates refine the family-level guide.

## Host computation

When the `compute-with-numpy` skill is installed alongside this skill, use `stability` on a supplied continuous or discrete state matrix; boundary spectra and nonlinear stability require additional analysis. Use its [analyze.py](../compute-with-numpy/scripts/analyze.py) helper and [input/command reference](../compute-with-numpy/references/command-line.md). `--example` prints a request to adapt; run the actual task with `--input /absolute/request.json` and retain the returned evidence scope and diagnostics.
